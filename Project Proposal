    After reviewing feasibility of creating an RPG game and than creating a software package for the game
our team has decided to change our final project for the semester.

- Casino type games to be played locally against computer
    - Stretch goal to allow multiplayer against different users

- Coding Language Python
    - Available to be played on both windows and osx platforms
    - Using RenPY IDE for development

- Games to be implemented
    - Spades
    - Roulette
    - BlackJack
    - Chuckaluck
    - Poker (Stretch Goal)

- All team members have experience coding in Python scripting Language
    - Potential problems in having the program run on both OSX and Windows 
        - If not feasible for both, will choose one
